      Hello! I'm Jill. Welcome to my digital home.

    <p><i>Me and the rest of "Team BASF" that participated in the 2017 Wish-A-Mile bicycle tour for Make-A-Wish Michigan.</i></p>
    <p>
      I am a detail-oriented visual and written communicator with a passion for storytelling and dialogue. With over 15 years of experience in writing, communication design, user design and website management, I have enjoyed a career that allows for my creativity to shine through. My current employer is the world's largest chemical company, BASF. Since 2015, I have worked as a marketing communication specialist for the BASF automotive coatings refinish division based out of Southfield, MI. In 2021 I decided to go back to school and pursue a master's degree in communication at Syracuse University to help me improve my craft for communicating with various audiences in all kinds of settings. As a sidenote, I also hope to be a published author someday.
