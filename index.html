      I am a detail-oriented visual and written communicator with a passion for storytelling and dialogue. With over 15 years of experience in writing, communication design, user design and website management, I have enjoyed a career that allows for some of my creativity to shine through. In 2021 I decided to go back to school and pursue a master's degree in communication at Syracuse University to help me improve my craft for communicating with various audiences in all kinds of settings.
